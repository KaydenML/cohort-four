# kaydenML's notes

## Introduction

Hi my name is Kayden Moroz Liebl and i am very excited to participate in this years cohort working hard to improve myself and my programming and problem-solving skills and learn even though im a permissionless participant.

 

## Planned Projects

Glados

- Project Proposal
  - https://github.com/KaydenML/cohort-four/blob/master/projects/Glados-PortalNetwork.md

Iâ€™m interested on working hard on Glados because I believe that it suits my skill set the best and is a great place to improve myself and learn and am planing on working hard creating interesting ways to visualize important data through different graphs on the page and trying to make everything look nicer and cleaner as well as the main page of glados. I am really interested in working hard and learning many new things as well as making many useful contributions towards glados during this year's cohort and excited to be able to contribute in every way that I can either that be by large or small implementations.
